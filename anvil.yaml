metadata: {description: 'This web application enables geologists and researchers to upload sedimentary rock composition data and automatically plot it on a QFL ternary diagram (Quartz–Feldspar–Lithic fragments). It assists in the classification of sandstones and provides insights into provenance and tectonic settings.  Key Features:  📤 Upload compositional data (CSV, Excel)  📊 Auto-generate QFL ternary diagrams  🧭 Classify samples based on standard sandstone types  🔍 Explore provenance and tectonic implications  📁 Export diagrams and analysis as images or reports  🔐 Optional user login to save and manage datasets  Ideal for geologists, sedimentologists, and students conducting petrographic analysis and tectonic studies', logo_img: 'asset:ElytraLab 511x511.jpg', title: QFL Ternary Builder - By Elytra Lab}
